Steps in order to successfully run the executable file(s), type the following into the command line:

    [1] 'make compile'                         (compiles all existing program code and checks for errors)

    [2] 'make run'                             (runs the 'shell' program)

    [3] 'make clean'                           (removes past executables for storage 'clean-up' purposes)
